    "# Using Tensorflow 2.0 with Bert on Natural Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be using the Bert baseline for Tensorflow to create predictions for the Natural Questions test set. Note that this uses a model that has already been pre-trained - we're only doing inference here. A GPU is required, and this should take between 1-2 hours to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original script can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/language/blob/master/language/question_answering/bert_joint/run_nq.py).\n",
    "The supporting modules were drawn from the [official Tensorflow model repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp). The bert-joint-baseline data is described [here](https://github.com/google-research/language/tree/master/language/question_answering/bert_joint).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This baseline uses code that was migrated from TF1.x. Be aware that it contains use of tf.compat.v1, which is not permitted to be eligible for [TF2.0 prizes in this competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow2-question-answering/overview/prizes). It is intended to be used as a starting point, but we're excited to see how much better you can do using TF2.0!"
